## 1. Will my BPI Bizlink access be affected?
No, it will not be affected. You may continue to enjoy the convenience of  transacting through BPI Bizlink.

## 2. What will happen to my BPI Family Savings Bank account enrolled in Cash Management and/or BPI Bizlink?
For accounts that will be integrated to BPI with the same account number and branch of account, no action will be needed from your end. You may continue to enjoy the convenience of transacting through BPI BizLink.

For accounts that will be transferred to another BPI branch where the account number will change, your affected BPI Family Savings Bank account will automatically be updated to the new account number. You may use the updated account number in your upload when processing your transactions starting on the effective date of the change in your account.

## 3. Can I still access my past BPI Family Savings Bank Statements of Account (SOA) in BPI BizLink?
If your account will be transferred to another BPI branch, your past Statements of Account for the old account number will no longer be available upon the effective date of the change.

If you wish to download your past BPI Family Savings Bank Statements of Account (SOA) in BPI Bizlink, you may do so before the effective date of the change in your account number.

## 4. How can I process Pay Employees, Pay BPI and Automatic Debit Arrangement (ADA) transactions involving BPI Family Savings payors/payees’ accounts that changed?
You will be receiving an encrypted file containing the list of old and new  account numbers of your affected payors/payees.  Please ensure that you  use the new account numbers in processing your transactions.

For Pay BPI, your payees will continue to be enrolled and their enrollment will be updated with their new BPI account numbers.

To have a seamless processing of third-party payments, you may also opt to use Pay BPI Unenrolled Variant. The upload file format for Pay BPI enrolled and unenrolled variants is the same.

For ADA, your payors will continue to be enrolled and their enrollment will be updated with their new BPI account numbers.

## 5. Where and when can I get the encrypted file containing the old and new account numbers?
The file can be downloaded upon your registered authorizer's log-in to Bizlink prior to the scheduled effective date of change in your account.

## 6. How can I obtain the password to open the encrypted file?
The password to open the file will be sent via the authorizer's registered email address in Bizlink prior to the receipt of the encrypted file.

## 7. What will happen if I was not able to change the old BPI Family Savings Bank account number in the upload file?
If the upload file contains old BPI Family Savings Bank account numbers, the transaction will be unsuccessful.

## 8. What if I have a BPI Family Savings Bank settlement account and a BPI settlement account?
Your BPI Family Savings Bank settlement account will be integrated to become a BPI settlement account. Your account will automatically be updated and the corresponding Merchant Payment Transaction Journal (MPTJ) will continue to be available for download in BPI Bizlink.
